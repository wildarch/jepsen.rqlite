  "Checks for a strict serializability anomaly in which T1 < T2, but T2 is
    visible without T1.
    We perform concurrent blind inserts across n tables, and meanwhile, perform
    reads of both tables in a transaction. To verify, we replay the history,
    tracking the writes which were known to have completed before the invocation
    of any write w_i. If w_i is visible, and some w_j < w_i is *not* visible,
    we've found a violation of strict serializability.
    Splits keys up onto different tables to make sure they fall in different
    shard ranges"
