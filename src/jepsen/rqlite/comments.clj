  "Checks for a strict serializability anomaly in which T1 < T2, but T2 is
  visible without T1.
  We perform concurrent blind inserts across n tables, and meanwhile, perform
  reads of both tables in a transaction. To verify, we replay the history,
  tracking the writes which were known to have completed before the invocation
  of any write w_i. If w_i is visible, and some w_j < w_i is *not* visible,
  we've found a violation of strict serializability.
  Splits keys up onto different tables to make sure they fall in different
  shard ranges"
